This is the functional part of my website.

-I like to keep things separated by class
-There is one parent class that allows other classes to inherit methods and properties
-I felt that a session class must be stand alone cause I dont want to clutter up the DB class (easier maintanance)
-Deff a work in progress, many more modifications will happen in the near future.
